Single ton pattern->where I am restricting a class to create only one object.
//blocks ->{}
code is considered as intilizaing
blocks are the also used to intilize members of the class specially non static members.
Types of blocks
1)instace intilization block or init block--->this is given to object
if it is instance class then first instance is called the constructor is called
2)static intilization block ex->static{ }--->this is given to className
two references pointing to one object only.
there is another way of doing it.
power of static blocks ->block always go and sit before main method
based on sequential manner blocks get executed.


static block is called first then instance block is called

for static we no need to create object.
for instance we need to create object

we cant write block inside a block
can we write block inside block?
can we write block inside a method
Yes,we can write block inside a method
