Exception is an unwanted triggered by jvm 
unwanted event occurs during execution of the program
Exception is class in java 
process of handling exception is called Exception Handling


try{

//code 
}

catch(ExceptionName ref){

}






if we want to handle error later ,instead of try catch we use throws keyword
returntype of printStackTrace() is void//

ways for creating try,catch
try{
}catch(){
}


try{
}catch(){
}catch(){
}


try{

}

finally{

}








ex:


try{
catch(Exception e){

}
finally{

}






Exception propogation
where exception is passes from one method to another method or stackcall/stackwinding

compiletime/check



if we have multiple catch we write generic at last 
try {
			
			Class.forName("com.xworkz.pubapp.bounce.Bounce");
			Bouncer.check(age); //becuz it is declared static
			//or bouncer.check(19);
		} catch (PubException e) {
			//catch(PubException | ClassNotFoundException),if more catch is there for same clause
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
			e.getMessage();
		}catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
			
			
			e.printStackTrace();// TODO: handle exception
		}
                    catch(Exception e){
              e.printStckTrace();
}
		finally {
			//close all the costly resources used for the application
			//whether exception occuring or not finnally executed mandatorly
			
		if(sc!=null) {
		sc.close();
		}
