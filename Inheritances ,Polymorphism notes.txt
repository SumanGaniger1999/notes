5)finalize()
6)notify()----------       "
7)notifyAll()------Multithreaded concept
8)wait()------------------------MO "
9)wait(one parameter)-----------Method overloading "
10)wait(two parameter)-----------MO "
11)clone()---used to create object without using new---It creates a multiple copy of a class. 

An object behaving differently at given instance of time is called polymorphism

Protected is always used in the inheritance

To perform polymorphism two objects are created

Two types of polymorphism:
1)Compile time polymorphism---also called method overloading or static Binding or polymorphism 
2)Run time      "-----Method overriding or dynamic polymorphism


In method overloading we have 2 types
1)Static overloading
2)non static overloading

The call to the method is decided by compile time is called compile time polymorphism
