//Method overloading

1)Two or more methods can have the same method name inside the same class if they accept different arguments.This feature is known as method overloading
2)Method overloading is achieved by either:
  i)changing the number of arguments or
     changing the datatypes of arguments
  ii)For methodoverloading there must be change in  parameters
advantage is increases readability of the program
