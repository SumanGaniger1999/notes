class is a design or blueprint which contains behavoir and state ,behavior in the form of method,state or properties in the form variable .
*object is a multiple copy of class
object is a physical entity which we can touch ,feel
object is instance of a class
Object characteristics
->Stste means it represent data of object
->behavior means it represent behavior of object
->identity means it represent unique name of object



object get created on java memory
object get created by reference variable
or each and every object is associated with reference variable in java memory

compiler initilazes default values
instance variable are variable as soon as 

class ClassName{

variables.
methods.           
constructor.     //All are building blocks or members
blocks..

}



variables
methods
blocks //these all are instances


if we dont write constructor java compiler writes the constructor..
command:-javap className

Types of constructor
parameters constructor
default constructor:default constructor with no parameters
constructor it is special type of method which will be same name as className with no return type and starts with uppercase
constructor is used to store instance variable of class
advantage of constructor to initialize the instance variable of class 

this =to avoid ambigety between local .this is used when instance and local variable created and if compiler wants to point instance variable we use tis keyword 
constructor is called when object is created

compiler points to local variable when instance and local variable is created
this -constructor,method,blocks
