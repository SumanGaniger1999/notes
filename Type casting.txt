// Type of casting are:data Typecasting and reference type casting
//reference is done when object is created
// upcasting is reference typecasting ex:-polymorphism,it contains parent ref and child object--giving parent reference to child object
//reference it is also called as is a relationship
//upcasting ->Bank bank= new BandhanBank();
//upcasting is mandatory
//downcasting is a typecasting of parent object to the child object
//downcasting means from generic to specific ,i.e parent to  child
//generic-parent class or object,specific-child class
//upcasting has to be done to do downcasting mandatorly
//if we write downcasting directly we get error i.e ClassCastException at runtime
//converting to String to any datatype it is parsing


// ex of downcasting ->BandhanBank   bandhanBank=new (BandhanBank)bank;
