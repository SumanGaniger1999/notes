List is a interface present java.util
subinterface of collection
List preserves insertion order
List is a ordered format 
ordered->it preserves insertion order
insertion->the order we insert the data in the list

It can accept enumber of null values
it accepts duplicate values

implementation help to insert in list

object is created using implement i.eArrayList<>()
Arraylist has default size has 10.
Arrylist is defined using datastrutre built on  resizable array
Java assign the default value

Formula for ArrayList 
int newCapacity= OldCapacity+(OldCapacity>>1)
it increases upto 50%
grow method helps to get newCapacity
if i want to add 11 then grow method helps to 

 search operation is faster in ArrayList uses RandomAccess
Only ArrayList class has randomAccess,but other classes dont have RandomAccess
ArryList implements three interfaces namely RandomAccess,Cloneable,Serializble
RandomAccess is a MarkerInterface(empty interface)ex:RandomAccess
RandomAccess helps to fectch faster then for loop
even Vector class uses RandomAccess but it is not used now becuze of size it becomes double

In ArrayList->
List has 
It will do upcasting
hasNext() method checks the data is present and return type is boolean
next() method return Object
