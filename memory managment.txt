two types of inside memory managment
1)heap memry
2)Stack memry

object are stored inside heap memory in java .

heap mrmy again has two types
1)new generation 
2)old generation

Object created into new generation
Again in new gen it has three parts
1)Eden memry
2)Suvivor memry1
3)Survivor memry2
inside new gen object created in eden mrmy

jvm calls GC(garbage Collection) to clear mrmy
What will happen when GC is called?
->all dereferenced object get clear out  

Whenever GC is called in old gen is called major GC 
Whenevrer GC is called in new gen is called minor gc

if a developer wants to call GC then we use finally method

major memry affects the application,so minor gc is good

Purpose of permanent Gen or nonHeap memry is:method Blocks
inide method ,blocks:class structures ,it has static,constant,static is called first

Stack is a place where application get started
Stack memory purpose to execute all methods we write in application
for each method frame gets created in stack memry
1method=1frame
all parameters go and store in frame
refrence variable is stored in stack mrmy ,inside stack in frame
all local variables get stored in frame
refrence variable will nt directly point to object,it points memory location of a particular object
stack memory will also have information of next line
after stack gets empty
