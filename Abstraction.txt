Hiding the implementation & allowing the user to access only the functionality with the help of interface is known as abstraction.
Change in a implementation which will not affect user loose coupling.It can be achieved only by interface. 
olp of abstraction is loose coupling

interface is media which communicate with user and any device.//two program
Change in a implementation which affecting the user is called type coupling.
advantage of abstraction is to achieve Loose coupling
Method which doesnot contains body is abstract method
interface contain abstract method
interface is a keyword in java
Abstracts is done by using implements.implements is keyword
abstract keyword is  with  class ,interface and methods.
interface contains abstract method.
interface doesnt contain constructors
we cannot create any interface in java
ISwitch iSwitch=new ISwitch();//we cannot create any interface in java i.e ISwitch

to achieve 100% interface class is better.


if we use interface left should be                 and rigth should be





eclipse
for creating interface ..we have to write I_ 
if we dont want to override then we use abstract keyword
ex:package com.xworkz.serveapp;

public abstract class HotelImplementation implements IShop {

	@Override
	public void served() {
     System.out.println("Served");
		
	}

	
}


hotelimplements shop
shop is a interface
functionality is serve
abstract

Factory Design Pattern-factory having different objects of same type
factory takes input as String and o/p as implementation object 


functionality of any object is not directly return to interface pr object
consumer logic is imp 

cart is interface
swipe is a functionaity
bank implementation
bankFactory

we cannot create 
in interface by default it takes variable public static final

abstract cannot have by default public static final
ex:if we want to write static then we should write static 
cannot have contructor for interface class
instantiate means object creation
we cannot intantiate interface and abstract
it is not mandatory to have abtract method in abstract class




class-we use public class 
if we know complete 
explicitly we have to specify static,local,instance variables
interface -we use interface keyword

variable will be default public static final


abstract-we use abstract keyword
variable

 
 class extends the abstract class
but interface only  implements 

multiple inheritance is not possible in java
i can overcome multiple inheritance through  interface

ex:
 public interface Box{
   void store();
}


public interface Box1{
void store();
}

public class Tupperware implements Box,Box1{

@Override
public void store(){

}
}












return impl object
