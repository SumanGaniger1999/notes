 //Data transfering object.....becuz to store data in dto .dto is considered as design(DTO is a Design Pattern)
DTO
In order to create a DTO ,we have to follow 5 rules 
5 Rules
1)the class defined as DTO  should be public class 
2)it should have one default constructor public PatientDTO(){
3)the class you contain must be private property or private data members.
4)all the private data we need to create as public getter and setter
getter means get method and setter means set method
5)
Setter is used to initlization
Two types of intilization
1)Construction initlization
2)Setter initlization

How will you achieve encapsulation ? By using private ..private contain data
Encapsulation is binding the data into single unit
What is the return type of getter?
the returntype of getter depends on data

Setter return type is void.
Through dto data is stored

private can be used for method and variables
private is a keyword we achieve encapsulation
classname Ends with DTO
Some organisation call Dto AS bean
