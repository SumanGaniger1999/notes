Array is a group of similar values or It is a container which store group of similar type of  data into a single variable.
  
 EX: String countryName={"India","Sri Lanka","England","South Africa","USA","Pakistan","China"};
 
     int    noOfStates={29,18,10,19,20,16,9,15};

always array values are associated with index

3 WAYS to declare arr
1.DataTypes variableName[];
2.DataTypes[] variableName;
3.datatype   []variableName;

length will stsrt with 1 so on
inbdex starts with 0 and ends with length-1


Syntax
datatype variableName[]={data};
datatype variableName=new datatype[length];

we can create different array by using Object type
constraint,
common problem -
user provides default value for array
array has no default value
