Database is collection of related data . 
DBMS is a platorm 

item as 
run

MySQL 
	

Choosing setup type
->

user ->root
SQL->Structured Query Language,it not case sensitive
Domine Specific->(for contacting witn relation data)
Declarative Lang(What to do)

to create and manage the database
CRUD

      Statements has DQL(data query language)->we use this to fetch data from the database
 
              SELECT is a command ,*->means all datas,FROM ->keywords
                  select variable,set_time from sys.sys_config;

DDL(data defination lang)
Use to handle the structure

CREATE DATABASE web_series;


DBMS
*It uses the navigational Structure 
*It dont use the concept of normalization
*It is designed for single user
*it doesnt supports destributed database system





RDBMS
*It uses relational structure to store the data
*uses concept of normalization
*It is designed for multiple user
*it is supports destributed database system


DATA TYPES

1)Number Type of data

            4       9    11  20
i)INT(TinyInt,MediumInt,INT,BigInt)-it holds 4 digits
ii)Float(size of digit,d)10,24
iii)Double(s,d)10,53
iv)Decimals(s,d)->to hold the data more than float and Double

2)Text Type of Data

Char (200)->stores one character
Varchar(s)->alphbets,numbers,special character
Text(TinyText,Text,MediumText,LongText)

3)Boolean and Binary
          0       1
Boolean(True or False)
Binary-
BLOB(Large Binary Object)
(Tiny,Large,Medium,Small)

4)Date and Time
i)Data(YYY-MM-DD) (2021-4-4)
ii)Time(HH:MM:SS)  (10:05:00)  
iii)DataTime(YYY-MM-DD  HH:MM:SS)
iv)TimeStamp(YYY-MM-DD  HH:MM:SS Zone)f
v)Year(YYY) 2021




VARCHAR(20)  Name
YEAR          Year
TINYINT      Seasons
CHAR(20)     Lang
VARCHAR(10)  Platform
INT          Episodes
FLOAT         Ratings

DML->(data manipulation language)

INSERT
Create-create database and table
*)ALTER CMDS-modify existing table 
drop column
rename column
rename tablename
modify the column datatype
where for condition


truncate-it is used to delete all the data from the table

update 
is editing existing data
jnm 

Delete

Drop
drop -it is used to delete the existing tables
it is used to delete the existing database

constraints

it is a rules to restrict the data that can go into a particular column.
Types of constraints

1.NOT NULL-it will restrict the null type of datar
2.UNIQUE -it doent allow duplicate data
3.primary key-combination of unique and not null
4.foriegn key-
5)default -decide the default value
6)check-provide condition to provide data





IN-multiple operators
Between-select range
Distinct -to fetch unique data or ignor duplicate data

order by-to sort data in ascn and desc

Limited-it is used fetch the selected number of  data,it always fetch the data from top

Pattern matching

LIKE-keyword or operator

wild card operators -this operator comes between we search
1.%-zero or more characters.

2._->represents only single characters

%rathna%-it can be starting with ratna or 

Alias 
name AS movies_name

Aggregate functions-it is used to do mathematical calculation.

1.MAX()-maximum value from the particular column
2.Min()
3.Avg()
4.Sum()
5.count()


Date and Time Function
1.CURDATE()->current date
2.curtime()->current time
3.
4.date('')
5.time('')
6.month('')
7.year()
8.day()

9.hour
8.mins
10.sec

Group By-it is used to organise the similar records into groups  based on the given columns.
	we can use order by with group by .
         we use group by always with select
Having -filter data on already grouped data,it is used to give the condition on already grouped data.
        it can be used to give the condition of aggregate functions.


      Difference btwn WHERE and HAVING
 
     WHERE                                                                              

     *Filter the data on individual row  
     *Where is used before group by 
     *it acts as a pre-filter
     *where cant be used with aggregate function     
     *WHERE is used to apply filter with row operation 
    

     HAVING


    *Filter on group data
    *Having is used before group by
    *it acts as  a pre-filter
    *Having can be used with aggregate functions
    *having is used to apply filter with column operation        



 ->  ORDER of keywords

   SELECT
   FROM
   WHERE
   GROUP BY 
   HAVING 
   ORDER BY 
   LIMIT


We can have any number of inner queries
