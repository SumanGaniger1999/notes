static vs instance 

class Institute{

static String name="X-workz";
       String address="Rajajinagar";

}


Institute ins = new Institute();
static are considered as class members---we need not to create object
static data shared with different objects in a memory
static members are loaded  class is loaded
for static we dont need to create objects
*static non access modifiers

instance are considered as object members             -----we should create object
instance members at the time when object is created
instance are not shared to different objects
for instance we need to create objects
