class is a design or blueprint which contains behavoir and state ,behavior in the form of method,state or properties in the form variable .
*object is a multiple copy of class
object is a physical entity which we can touch ,feel
object is instance of a class
new -object


constructor is being called as a time of object creation
object get created on java memory
object get created by reference variable
or each and every object is associated with reference variable in java memory

compiler initilazes default values
instance variable are variable as soon as 

class ClassName{
         
variables.
methods.           
constructor.     //All are building blocks or members
blocks.

}



variables
methods
blocks //these all are instances


if we dont write constructor java compiler writes the constructor..
command:-javap className

Types of constructor
parameter constructor
default constructor:default constructor with no parameters
constructor it is special type of method which will be same name as className with no return type and starts with uppercase
constructor should be same as class name
it is created when instance of object is created
constructor is used to store instance variable of class
advantage=to initialize the instance variable of class 

this()- this method is used to call constructor from another constructor in a same  class
constructor chaining -this method
constructor chaining is one where we call another constructor in a same class using this()

this keyword
->this it is reference variable that refers current object
usage
->this can be used to refer current class inheritance variable
->this is used to invoke current class method.
-this can be passed as a arguments in the method call
->this can be passed as arguments in the constructor call
